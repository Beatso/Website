# Little Improvements: Custom
Little Improvements: Custom is an open-source resource pack picker that I coded from scratch. There is a team of three texture artists (Kemiu, Daggsy and myself) who make textures and resource packs for LIC.

# Resource Packs

I make a bunch of tweaks resource packs, that aim to improve the vanilla game in small ways. These include:

- [Little Improvements: Variated](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/little-improvements-variated/), which adds alternate textures to many blocks; adding variety to the game, and avoiding grid patterns.

- [Little Improvements: Redstone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/little-improvements-redstone/) which is a utility pack that adds small quality of life additions to redstone components.

- [Connected Smooth Stone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/connected-smooth-stone-no-optifine/), which, uhh, makes smooth stone connected.

All my resource packs can be found on my [Planet Minecraft profile](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/beatso/).


# Resource Pack Info

Resource Pack Info  is a small wiki for bits of info that can be useful when creating a Minecraft resource pack. It's mostly stuff that I didn't find was immediately obvious when searching the web.
