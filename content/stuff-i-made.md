A collection of things I made. [Minecraft Stuff](#minecraft-stuff) [Other Stuff](#other-stuff)



# Minecraft Stuff

## Little Improvements: Custom
Little Improvements: Custom is an open-source resource pack picker that I coded from scratch. There is a team of three texture artists (Kemiu, Daggsy and myself) who make textures and resource packs for LIC.

## Resource Packs

I make a bunch of tweaks resource packs, that aim to improve the vanilla game in small ways. These include:

- [Little Improvements: Variated](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/little-improvements-variated/), which adds alternate textures to many blocks; adding variety to the game, and avoiding grid patterns.

- [Little Improvements: Redstone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/little-improvements-redstone/) which is a utility pack that adds small quality of life additions to redstone components.

- [Connected Smooth Stone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/connected-smooth-stone-no-optifine/), which, uhh, makes smooth stone connected.

All my resource packs can be found on my [Planet Minecraft profile](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/beatso/).


## Resource Pack Info

Resource Pack Info  is a small wiki for bits of info that can be useful when creating a Minecraft resource pack. It's mostly stuff that I didn't find was immediately obvious when searching the web.

## FingerMaps

I am the website and bot developer for the FingerMaps team, a map making team that currently has two maps published. We aim to create unique and interesting maps using custom data packs, mechanics, resource packs and other stuff.

## Vanilla Extract

I'm also part of the team at Vanilla Extract, which is another Minecraft resource pack picker. I made the discord bot, I help out with the website, and I am part of the RP Support team.
