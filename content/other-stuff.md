## RedditSpyglass

A small website to see how many points a reddit post has, even if it's hidden. [Website](https://beatso.github.io/RedditSpyglass/)


## Translate Nonsense

A Python program to translate text through many languages so it becomes nonsense. [GitHub](https://github.com/Beatso/TranslateNonsense)


## Pinn

A discord bot so anyone can pin messages, even if they don't have the manage messages permission. [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/763842999573544981)


## Custom Discord Bots

I make a bunch of discord bots in discord.js. They're all on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Beatso?tab=repositories).
