heyo! i'm beatso. i make minecraft resource packs, amongst other stuff. i also do a bit of code.

i make a bunch of useless stuff, some of it to do with minecraft, some code, some both.  
i've made a [custom resource pack picker](https://www.littleimprovements-custom.tk/) for minecraft, which i coded from scratch in javascript. i also made textures for it, along with [daggsy](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/daggsy/) and [kemiu](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/kemiu/).  
i am the dev for the [fingermaps](https://fingermaps.net/) map making team, and part of the dev team at [vanilla extract](https://www.vanilla-extract.tk/). check out all the [minecraft stuff](/minecraft-stuff) i do.

i also do a bit of programming. i made a few useless websites, some discord bots and other bits and pieces. [check them out](/other-stuff).

i have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/bnczjfe), a close community to hang out, talk about code, minecraft textures and anything in between. come say hi :)
