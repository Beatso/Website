hey! i'm beatso. i make minecraft resource packs, amongst other stuff. i also do a bit of code.

i like minecraft. i do a bunch of things to do with the game.  
i've made a [custom resource pack picker](https://www.littleimprovements-custom.tk/) for minecraft, which i coded from scratch. i also made textures for it, along with daggsy and kemiu.  
i am part of the [fingermaps](https://fingermaps.net/) map making team, and the website team at [vanilla extract](https://sites.google.com/view/vanillaextract). check out all the [minecraft stuff](/minecraft-stuff) i do.

i am also a keen programmer. i made a few useless websites, some discord bots and other bits and pieces. [check it out](/other-stuff).

i have my own [discord server](https://discord.gg/bnczjfe), a community with over 100 members. come join and hang out :)
