Hey! I'm Beatso. I make Minecraft resource packs, amongst other stuff. I also do a bit of code.

I like Minecraft. I do a bunch of things to do with the game.  
I've made a [custom resource pack picker](https://www.littleimprovements-custom.tk/) for Minecraft, which I coded from scratch. I also made textures for it, along with Daggsy and Kemiu.  
I am part of the [FingerMaps](https://fingermaps.net/) map making team, and the Website Team at [Vanilla Extract](https://sites.google.com/view/vanillaextract). Check out all the [Minecraft stuff](/minecraft-stuff) I do.

I am also a keen programmer. I made a few useless websites, some discord bots and other bits and pieces. [Check it out](/other-stuff).

I have my own [discord server](https://discord.gg/bNcZjFe), a community with over 100 members. Come join and hang out :)
