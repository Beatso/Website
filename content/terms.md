this page outlines how you can and can't use my resource packs.

# you may:
- use my resource packs for personal use and on multiplayer servers.
- combine assets from my resource packs for personal mashup packs, that **are not** distributed.
- use my resource packs in videos/streams without credit. a link to my planet minecraft page would be appreciated but is not required.


# you may not:
- distribute assets from my resource packs without explicit permission. this includes in public mashup packs, or in resource packs you are making.
- share any assets i made behind a paywall (e.g. ad link)

# credit

if you have permission to use assets that i made in a resource pack you are making, please include the following credit:

credit me (beatso) and include a link to the website from which someone can download the assets i made (such as the pmc page for that submission).

this should be done on the website from which you are distributing your resource pack, and in a credits.txt inside the pack.
