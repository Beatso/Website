## resource packs

i make a bunch of tweaks resource packs, that aim to improve the vanilla game in small ways. these include:

- [little improvements: variated](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/little-improvements-variated/), which adds alternate textures to many blocks; adding variety to the game, and avoiding grid patterns.

- [little improvements: redstone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/little-improvements-redstone/) which is a utility pack that adds small quality of life additions to redstone components.

- [connected smooth stone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/connected-smooth-stone-no-optifine/), which, uhh, makes smooth stone connected.

all my resource packs can be found on my [planet minecraft profile](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/beatso/).


## resource pack info

resource pack info  is a small wiki for bits of info that can be useful when creating a minecraft resource pack. it's mostly stuff that i didn't find was immediately obvious when searching the web.
